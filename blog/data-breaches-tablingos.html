					In recent months, several high-profile companies have fallen
					victim to devastating data breaches, exposing the sensitive
					information of millions of customers. As a leading data
					management platform, Tablingos is committed to helping its
					customers navigate these turbulent waters and safeguard
					their data.
				</p>
				<br />

				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-5 mt-8">
					The Okta Breach
				</h3>
				<p>
					Okta, the identity and access management company, reported a
					security breach in October 2023 where hackers gained access
					to private customer information through its customer support
					management system. The attackers were able to view content
					uploaded by Okta customers, including HTTP archive (HAR)
					files that can contain sensitive data such as cookies and
					session tokens. Okta has since revoked embedded session
					tokens and advised customers to sanitize credentials within
					HAR files before sharing.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					The breach at Okta is particularly concerning as the company
					is a trusted provider of identity and access management
					services to thousands of organizations worldwide. The fact
					that hackers were able to infiltrate Okta's systems and
					access customer data highlights the vulnerability of even
					the most secure platforms.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					One of the key lessons from the Okta breach is the
					importance of maintaining strict access controls and
					monitoring for suspicious activity within customer support
					systems. Okta has acknowledged that the breach occurred due
					to a lapse in its own security protocols, and the company
					has since implemented additional measures to prevent similar
					incidents in the future.
				</p>
				<br />

				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-5 mt-8">
					The 23andMe Breach
				</h3>
				<p>
					In December 2023, genetic testing firm 23andMe revealed that
					a hacker or hackers had accessed nearly seven million
					customer profiles, including ancestry reports, zip codes,
					and birth years. The breach occurred through a technique
					called credential stuffing, where hackers reused old
					usernames and passwords from other websites to break into
					23andMe accounts. 23andMe has since required all customers
					to reset their passwords and use two-step verification.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					The 23andMe breach is a stark reminder of the importance of
					robust password management and the need for multi-factor
					authentication. Credential stuffing attacks are becoming
					increasingly common, and companies must take proactive steps
					to protect their customers' accounts.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					For Tablingos customers, this breach highlights the
					importance of implementing strong password policies and
					encouraging the use of two-factor authentication. By
					ensuring that your customers' login credentials are secure,
					you can significantly reduce the risk of similar breaches
					occurring within your own organization.
				</p>
				<br />

				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-5 mt-8">
					The Air Europa Breach
				</h3>
				<p>
					Most recently, in March 2024, International Consolidated
					Airlines Group S.A. warned Air Europa customers that their
					personal data, including passport information, identity
					cards, birthdays, names, nationalities, and phone numbers,
					may have been compromised due to a security incident
					discovered in October 2023.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					The Air Europa breach is particularly concerning as it
					involves the exposure of sensitive personal information,
					such as passport details. This type of data can be used for
					identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities,
					putting affected customers at significant risk.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					For Tablingos customers, the Air Europa breach underscores
					the importance of implementing robust data security
					measures, particularly when handling sensitive personal
					information. This may include encryption, access controls,
					and regular security audits to ensure that your customers'
					data is protected from unauthorized access or misuse.
				</p>
				<br />

				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-5 mt-8">
					Tablingos' Approach to Data Security
